Managing resources is referred to as resource management, and includes both preventing resource leaks (releasing a resource when a process has finished using it) and dealing with resource contention (when multiple processes wish to access a limited resource).",[2293,2294,2296,2298],{"@id":1926},{"@id":2295},"d3f:SystemConfigurationInitResource",{"@id":2297},"d3f:UserLogonInitResource",{"@id":1526},[2300],"Local Resource",[2302],"System Resource",{"@id":2304,"rdfs:label":2305,"skos:altLabel":2307},"d3f:LocalResourceAccess",[2306],"Local Resource Access",[2308],"Endpoint Resource Access",{"@id":2310,"rdfs:label":2311},"d3f:LocalUserAccount",[2312],"Local User Account",{"@id":1435,"d3f:definition":2314,"rdfs:hasSubClass":2316,"rdfs:label":2322,"skos:altLabel":2324},[2315],"A record of events in the order of their occurrence.",[2317,2318,2320,2321],{"@id":1641},{"@id":2319},"d3f:PacketLog",{"@id":839},{"@id":867},[2323],"Log",[2325],"Chronology",{"@id":1713,"d3f:definition":2327,"rdfs:hasSubClass":2329,"rdfs:label":2333},[2328],"A log file is a file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software runs, or messages between different users of a communication software.

One difference is what type of software is able to follow them:\n\n - Symbolic links are automatically resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic links or not.\n\n - Shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers) treat them as references to other files.\n\nAnother difference are the capabilities of the mechanism:\n\n - Microsoft Windows shortcuts normally refer to a destination by an absolute path (starting from the root directory), whereas POSIX symbolic links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a relative path. The latter is useful if both the location and destination of the symbolic link share a common path prefix[clarification needed], but that prefix is not yet known when the symbolic link is created (e.g., in an archive file that can be unpacked anywhere).\n\n- Microsoft Windows application shortcuts contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute or relative pathnames.\n\n- Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed. Windows domain clients may subscribe to a Windows service called Distributed Link Tracking to track the changes in files and folders to which they are interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files and folders are moved across the network.[14] Additionally, in Windows 9x and later, Windows shell tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before proposing to delete it.",[3383],{"@id":3384},"d3f:WindowsShortcutFile",[3386],"Shortcut File",{"@id":3388,"d3f:definition":3389,"rdfs:hasSubClass":3391,"rdfs:label":3393,"skos:altLabel":3395},"d3f:SlowSymbolicLink",[3390],"A slow symbolic link is any symbolic link on a Unix filesystem that is not a fast symbolic link; slow symlink is thus retroactively termed from fast symlink.

How it works\n\nURLs may contain components, for example:\n\n * scheme\n * userinfo\n * host name\n * port\n * path\n * query\n * fragment\n\nThese components are used as features in analysis algorithms.\n\nContextual information about a URL such as where it is embedded (ex. emails, files, network protocols), header, path, location, and origin information, as well as information about the content returned from the URL request, may be incorporated into an analytic for URL analysis. For example, if a URL indicates a .pdf file but an executable is actually returned, the combination of these two pieces of information indicates suspicious activity.\n\nAdditional techniques include:\n\n* Extracting features of a URL such as domain name length, ratio of consecutive consonants, percentage of digits in a domain, and number of vowels. Values for each feature are combined to develop a score for the URL.\n* Determining the probability of a character occurring in the URL given the preceding two characters. For example, for google.com, the probability of a 'g' occurring at the beginning of a word, the probability of an 'o' occurring after a \"g, the probability of an o\" occurring after a 'g' and \"o, and so forth. A dictionary or a list of known good domains is used to determine probability. Probabilities are multiplied to develop a score for the URL.\n\nURL analysis may trigger follow-on analytics such as **File Analysis**\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Volume of URLs being analyzed, combined with the speed at which they are analyzed\n* Fidelity of analysis technique at detecting brand new URLs versus analyzing URLs of established domains",{"subject":10366,"predicate":10367,"object":10369},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10368},"http:\u002F\u002Fd3fend.mitre.org\u002Fontologies\u002Fd3fend.owl#kb-reference",{"type":178,"value":10370},"http:\u002F\u002Fd3fend.mitre.org\u002Fontologies\u002Fd3fend.owl#Reference-MethodAndApparatusForDetectingMaliciousWebsites_EndgameInc",{"subject":10372,"predicate":10373,"object":10374},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10368},{"type":178,"value":10375},"http:\u002F\u002Fd3fend.mitre.org\u002Fontologies\u002Fd3fend.owl#Reference-MethodAndSystemForDetectingRestrictedContentAssociatedWithRetrievedContent_SophosLtd",{"subject":10377,"predicate":10378,"object":10380},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10379},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F1999\u002F02\u002F22-rdf-syntax-ns#type",{"type":178,"value":6078},{"subject":10382,"predicate":10383,"object":10384},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10379},{"type":178,"value":10385},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2002\u002F07\u002Fowl#NamedIndividual",{"subject":10387,"predicate":10388,"object":10389},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10379},{"type":178,"value":10390},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2002\u002F07\u002Fowl#Class",{"subject":10392,"predicate":10393,"object":10395},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10394},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2000\u002F01\u002Frdf-schema#label",{"type":165,"value":4930},{"subject":10397,"predicate":10398,"object":10400},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10399},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2000\u002F01\u002Frdf-schema#subClassOf",{"type":178,"value":6078},{"subject":10402,"predicate":10403,"object":10404},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"type":178,"value":10399},{"type":10405,"value":10406},"bnode","t96100",{"subject":10408,"predicate":10410,"object":10412},{"type":178,"value":10409},"http:\u002F\u002Fd3fend.mitre.org\u002Fontologies\u002Fd3fend.owl#M1021",{"type":178,"value":10411},"http:\u002F\u002Fd3fend.mitre.org\u002Fontologies\u002Fd3fend.owl#related",{"type":178,"value":10345},{"subject":10414,"predicate":10415,"object":10417},{"type":178,"value":10370},{"type":178,"value":10416},"http:\u002F\u002Fd3fend.mitre.org\u002Fontologies\u002Fd3fend.owl#kb-reference-of",{"type":178,"value":10345},{"subject":10419,"predicate":10420,"object":10421},{"type":178,"value":10375},{"type":178,"value":10416},{"type":178,"value":10345},{"subject":10423,"predicate":10424,"object":10425},{"type":10405,"value":10406},{"type":178,"value":10379},{"type":178,"value":10426},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2002\u002F07\u002Fowl#Restriction",{"subject":10428,"predicate":10429,"object":10431},{"type":10405,"value":10406},{"type":178,"value":10430},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2002\u002F07\u002Fowl#onProperty",{"type":178,"value":432},{"subject":10433,"predicate":10434,"object":10436},{"type":10405,"value":10406},{"type":178,"value":10435},"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2002\u002F07\u002Fowl#someValuesFrom",{"type":178,"value":10348},"export

That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.
