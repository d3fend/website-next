For example, the x86 instruction `b0 0b: mov $11, %ax`, with no further alterations to the `%ax` register, followed by `cd 80: syscall` executes the system call `execve()` in the Linux kernel, which replaces the current process with another one specified -- this is a common action in shellcode, so this sequence would be flagged.\n\nThis technique detects shellcode despite whether or not it would cause a buffer overflow in the target binary.\n\nIf the sequence of bytes contains a sequence similar to that used in malicious shellcode, the entire byte sequence is flagged and a follow-on technique may be invoked.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### False Negatives\nIf the shellcode instructions are far apart, simple implementations might not detect the shellcode.\n\nDue to the nature of assembly instructions not having a defined start or end, implementations which do not process all start sequences (for example, when they a find byte sequence of interest, continue scanning forwards from the end of it) might not detect the shellcode.\n\nThis technique might not detect more complex or obfuscated instructions.  For that purpose, Dynamic Analysis or Emulated File Analysis could assist by analyzing the actual instruction function.\n\nThis technique may not detect self-modifying code.  To make it harder for a process to modify itself, Process Segment Execution Prevention should be used, while noting its considerations.\n\nThis technique might not detect malicious shellcode which reuses instructions in the target binary for malicious effect, as memory references in the presumed assembly code are not dereferenced.  Dynamic Analysis and Emulated File Analysis, when set up properly to fork from the running target binary, might detect this.  Process Segment Execution Prevention combined with Segment Address Offset Randomization frequently makes introduction of shellcode through overwriting a saved return pointer more difficult.  Call stack depth analysis might detect excessive reuse of instructions in the target binary.  Shadow Stack Frames might detect that a stack frame's return address has changed and Stack Frame Canary Verification might detect that the stack frame's return address was overwritten.  Other heuristic methods might detect jump-oriented programming shellcode.\n\nWith inserting code directly, that it is not a buffer overflow, and just some place where code is executed either to a file or a write-what-where, the buffer overflow mitigations do not help.  Behavioral analysis could detect this, or proper access control could mitigate this.\n\n### False Positives\n\nByte sequences containing code that is never used as machine code are still analyzed and flagged for anomalies, and [eventually](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55871.html), it is likely that an attack sequence will arise from the sheer volume of bytes transmitted.",[5990,5992],{"@id":5991},"d3f:Reference-Network-BasedBufferOverflowDetectionByExploitCodeAnalysis_InformationSecurityResearchCentre",{"@id":5993},"d3f:Reference-Network-levelPolymorphicShellcodeDetectionUsingEmulation",[5995],"Shellcode Transmission Detection",[5997],"Byte Sequence Emulation",[5999],{"@id":5707},{"@id":6001,"@type":6002,"d3f:authenticates":6003,"d3f:d3fend-id":6005,"d3f:definition":6007,"d3f:kb-article":6009,"d3f:kb-reference":6011,"d3f:reads":6014,"rdfs:label":6016,"rdfs:subClassOf":6018},"d3f:Certificate-basedAuthentication",[6001,1421,1422],[6004],{"@id":2361},[6006],"D3-CBAN",[6008],"Requiring a digital certificate in order to authenticate a user.",[6010],"## How it works\n\nCertificate-based authentication is a security mechanism that uses digital certificates to verify the identity of a user, device, or server before granting access to a network or system.

Certificates or public keys can be pinned after a trusted connection has been established or the pinning can be preloaded in an application, which is the preferred method for mobile applications.\n\nPinning can take the form of certificate pinning or public key pinning.\n\n## Forms of Pinning\n* Certificate Pinning (CP) allows for the client to verify the X.509 certificate with a preloaded certificate. Typically, this is involves storing a hash of the certificate and using the stored hash for comparison to the hash of the certificate submitted during the SSL handshake.\n\n* Public Key Pinning (PKP) requires the extraction of a public key from server's certificate. The stored public key is compared to the server's presented public key. A public key is expected to rotate less frequently than an X.509 certificate and is generally favored over certificate pinning.\n\nAn extension of PKP is Subject Public Key Information Pinning (SPKI) includes public key pinning plus additional information for SSL connections. The additional information can include preferred algorithms.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* With pinned certificates whenever a server updates its certificate, the pinned certificates will also need to be updated\n* With pinned public keys the extracted key may be subject to key refresh policies but much less frequently\n* Servers can become unavailable if pinned objects are set and not updated with the rotated identities. This may require a pinning strategy to be developed.\n* The application of this technique within web browser applications has been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) by  popular web browser developers.

The method by which this exception handler is determined varies by the operating system.  The exception handler is called, even if it is the default exception handler to terminate the program and display a message that the program stopped working.  In the case that no valid exception handler is found, the program would fail to proceed as normal and could be programmed to terminate.\n\nIn Windows, the address of the exception registration record is stored at the very start of the the Thread Information Block; the GS register points to this structure.\n\nThe exception registration record contains two pointers: a pointer to the next exception registration record should this handler fail to handle the exception, and a pointer to the handler.\n\nA buffer overflow can overwrite the saved return pointer with an invalid location to execute memory; this often triggers the exception handler chain, which could also be corrupted by the buffer overflow.  Although Process Exception Handler Validation does not make sure that the exception handler pointer or the code at the exception handler was unaltered, or that the exception handler code is secure, this technique does ensure that the pointer is at least an exception handler that could be called by the program.\n\nWith Process Exception Handler Validation, before the handler is called, it checks the exception handler against a source of valid exception handlers.  If the requested handler is not in this list, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.\n\n### Runtime valid exception handler source generation\nThe source of valid exception handlers could be generated at runtime, with the risk of the information that is used to determine the validity of exception handlers being compromised.\n\n### Compile-time\nThe source of valid exception handlers could also be generated at compile time or as a binary patch.  Given the source code, it would be rather straightforward to find the exceptions, as they are pointed in the catch statement of a try-catch clause and the compiler must already generate the code to call exceptions from this.\n\n## Considerations\nIf the program file can be altered by the attacker, then the security could be bypassed by replacing it with any desired program, without even bypassing SEH.\n\nIf the attacker was already able to overwrite the code for a valid exception handler via other functionality in the program, this defense would not prevent arbitrary code execution.\nIf an exception handler recognized as valid is vulnerable, it would be executed anyway.\n\nSafeSEH might be applied only to some executable files or modules, allowing an attacker to call any piece of code as an exception handler in the unprotected modules.",[7048],{"@id":7049},"d3f:Reference-SAFESEH_ImageHasSafeExceptionHandlers_MicrosoftDocs",[7051],"Exception Handler Validation",[7053],{"@id":2287},[7055],"Exception Handler Pointer Validation",[7057,7058],{"@id":5732},{"@id":7059},"_:t220832",{"@id":7061,"@type":7062,"d3f:blocks":7063,"d3f:d3fend-id":7065,"d3f:definition":7067,"d3f:kb-article":7069,"d3f:kb-reference":7071,"d3f:restricts":7076,"d3f:synonym":7078,"rdfs:label":7080,"rdfs:subClassOf":7082},"d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting",[7061,5952,1421,1422],[7064],{"@id":2533},[7066],"D3-EAL",[7068],"Using a digital signature to authenticate a file before opening.",[7070],"## How it works\n\nThis technique is generic and there are numerous ways to compute and authenticate digital signatures.\nA digital certificate is generated from a private/public key pair issued by a certificate authority (CA).

Access determinations are based on designed access control polices and are not based on local resource owner determinations.\n\nAccess is typically granted by defining sets of subjects and sets of objects. Subjects are the entities requesting access and objects are the resources that subjects are trying to access. Rules and policies are defined that associate subjects and object permissions and access controls.\n\n### Common MAC implementations\n#### Security label access control\nA fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels to individual resources, including processes, and the access control decisions are against a particular resource and a given user attempting to gain access. This type of MAC requires that the file system has built-in support for security labels.\n\nAccess controls are typically implemented through the use of label identifiers for every file system object. Identifier labels are applied to resources and users are assigned a similar access identifier. Users attempting to access a resource will result in the operating system performing an access control check. The access control check will compare the assigned user's credentials to that of the resource or object they are attempting to access.\n\nA security context is associated with resources and is used to determine assess. Typical basic access control elements include users, roles and types and together they form a security context which is the basis for the security labels.\n\nThis type of access control is what is employed in SELinux [2]. This form of MAC is considered the most flexible implementation, but it also is the most complex to deploy across the enterprise. Where multiple virtual machines (VM) are run together this type of access control is typically employed to ensure true isolation of processes and VMs.\n\n#### File path level controls\nA less fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels that allow for access control at the file path level.  Access control is filesystem agnostic and no relabeling of resources is required. Pathname access control usually seems more natural for implementation and corresponding access audits.\n\nThis type of MAC is what is employed in AppArmor [3]. AppArmor was developed to provide a simpler alternative MAC method with much less management overhead. A simple access policy is maintained that defines path resource access rules. Access control attributes are typically associated with programs instead of users.\n\n\n## Considerations\nSome implementations of security label mandatory access control contain complex rules set that are hard to verify and complex to maintain over time.\n\nInitial planning of access model and continuous monitoring of the available users, resources and object is necessary.\n\n## Implementations\n\n * Linux C-Groups, and policy engines like SELinux and AppArmor\n * Windows Mandatory Integrity Control introduced in Windows Vista\n\n\n### Citations\n1.

In email, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol is typically used to digitally sign messages. A hash value of the sender's message is created and encrypted with the sender's private key to create a digital signature. The message and the digital signature are sent to the recipient where the sender's public key is used to decrypt the digital signature and compute the hash of the message. The computed hash is compared with the hash from the received message, and any difference in the hash values signify the message did not originate from the sender and has been alerted in transit.\n\n### Message Authentication Code (MAC)\nMAC is a fixed size string that is appended to a message to provide message authentication and integrity. The sender MAC signing algorithm takes as input a secret symmetric key shared between sender and recipient and the message to calculate a short tag that is appended to the message. The recipient receives the message with the appended tag, and a MAC verification algorithm is run using the symmetric key to verify the message came from the stated sender and ensure the message has not been tampered with.\n\n## Considerations\n- Public keys associated with digital signatures should be verified by a Certification Authority (CA) to prevent impersonation.

These signatures typically match against specific byte sequences, packet header information, or protocol anomalies indicative of known threats.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n* Packet Capture: Network traffic is captured on an interface or port, resulting in a stream of raw packets.\n* Preprocessing: The captured packets are preprocessed, cleaning and normalizing the data for efficient analysis.\n* Signature Matching: Each packet is compared against a database of signatures using dedicated engines.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### False Negatives\n\nNetwork signature analysis is susceptible to generating false negatives. These occur when malicious activity evades detection due to limitations in the signature-based approach. Here are some common causes:\n\n* Evolving threats: Attackers frequently modify their tactics, rendering existing signatures ineffective against new variants.\n* Obfuscation: Attackers may disguise malicious content using encryption, encoding, or other techniques to bypass signature detection.\n* Limited visibility: Signatures rely on specific patterns. If crucial information is encrypted or hidden, the signature might miss the threat.\n* Zero-day attacks: By definition, new and unknown attacks lack corresponding signatures, allowing them to pass undetected.\n\n### False Positives\n\nNetwork signature analysis is susceptible to generating false positives. These occur when the signature analysis triggers an alert for benign traffic. Common causes include:\n\n* Overly broad signatures: Rules designed to be too general might match harmless activities, generating false alarms.\n* Network misconfigurations: Improperly configured devices or legitimate network activity can mimic malicious patterns, triggering false positives.\n* Data errors: Corrupted or incomplete network data can lead to misinterpretations and false alerts.\n\n",[8420],"Network Traffic Signature Analysis",[8422,8423],{"@id":5707},{"@id":8424},"_:t220598",{"@id":8248,"@type":8426,"d3f:d3fend-id":8427,"d3f:definition":8429,"d3f:evaluates":8431,"d3f:identifies":8433,"rdfs:label":8435,"rdfs:subClassOf":8437},[8248,1422,1421],[8428],"D3-NVA",[8430],"Network vulnerability assessment relates all the vulnerabilities of a network's components in the context of their configuration and interdependencies and can also include assessing risk emerging from the network's design as a whole, not just the sum of individual network node or network segment vulnerabilities.",[8432],{"@id":2325},[8434],{"@id":5818},[8436],"Network Vulnerability Assessment",[8438,8439,8441],{"@id":6704},{"@id":8440},"_:t220620",{"@id":8442},"_:t220773",{"@id":6236,"@type":8444,"d3f:authenticates":8445,"d3f:d3fend-id":8447,"d3f:definition":8449,"d3f:kb-article":8451,"d3f:kb-reference":8453,"d3f:synonym":8456,"d3f:use-limits":8458,"rdfs:label":8460,"rdfs:seeAlso":8462,"rdfs:subClassOf":8465},[6236,1421,1422],[8446],{"@id":2363},[8448],"D3-OTP",[8450],"A one-time password is valid for only one user authentication.",[8452],"## How it works\n\nWhen a user initiates authentication, they are asked for a one-time password, often in addition to other credentials such as a traditional password or smart card.

There are benefits and disadvantages to each approach.\n\nThere are various strategies for developing filtering rulesets:\n\n* Block everything by default\n* Limit destination hosts\n* Limit destination transport or application protocols\n* Restrict content outbound (Ex. strings formatted as social security numbers, or proprietary data)\n\n## Considerations\n* Dynamic IP assignment creates challenges for Outbound Traffic Filtering because users are not necessarily associated with the same IP address. This can be addressed by linking IP address management information with the filtering logic.\n* Connections using non-standard transport layer ports may circumvent outbound traffic filtering technology which does not detect application protocol based on traffic content.\n* Business requirements typically drive the development of filtering rule sets.\n\n## Implementations\n- iptables (Linux)\n- Windows Firewall\n- pf (BSD)",[8636],{"@id":7864},[8638],"Outbound Traffic Filtering",[8640,8641],{"@id":7873},{"@id":8642},"_:t221050",{"@id":6030,"@type":8644,"d3f:d3fend-id":8645,"d3f:definition":8647,"d3f:kb-article":8649,"d3f:kb-reference":8651,"rdfs:label":8656,"rdfs:subClassOf":8658},[6030,1421,1422],[8646],"D3-PCA",[8648],"Collecting host certificates from network traffic or other passive sources like a certificate transparency log and analyzing them for unauthorized activity.",[8650],"## How it works\nCertificates are analyzed outside of a TLS server connection using third-party secure update logs, domain name analysis and analytics.\n\n### Secure update certificate logs\n* Certificate Logs\nThe key enabling feature is a secure service that maintains record logs of certificate activities. The logs allow users to only append certificates and never to delete or modify the log entries. The logs use Merkle Tree Hashes to ensure they have not been tampered with. The logging service also allows for public auditing by any user.\n\nThe logging service, upon receipt of a certificate to log, will respond with a signed certificate timestamp (SCT). The SCT guarantees the certificate will be added to the log within the time specified. The SCT must be present with the certificate during a TLS handshake.\n\n* Certificate Monitoring\nCertificate monitoring, of the logs, is typically done by the CA and they watch for suspicious certificate logging and unusual certificates or extensions or permissions. Monitors are also responsible for verifying the logs are accurate and public.\n\n* Certificate Auditors\nLog integrity is verified by log auditors. Auditors make use of log proofs are used to validate the cryptographic hashes (Merkle Trees) that the log employs are consistent. In order to ensure consistency throughout multiple monitors and auditors, sharing a common logging service, gossip protocol is employed.\n\n### Phishing domain name analysis\n* A curated corpus of known benign domains and phishing domain names is used as training text for machine learning. Through the use of feature set extraction, vectors labels are created with scoring to indicated if they are considered benign or phishing domains.\n\n* A stream of new or updated SSL certificates with fully qualified domain names (FQDN) is analyzed against the feature vectors and a predictive model determines a score for the domains. The scoring considers distance measures such as Levenshtein distance to help in determining the final label score. Supervised learning is also employed using the curated domains of benign and phishing domains.\n\n* Subdomain phishing analysis, prepending a trusted domain to a phishing domain, and regular expression comparisons  are also used in the label scoring model. A tunable measure is used to determine the threshold for alerting. This measure helps to balance between precision and recall measures.\n\n## Considerations\n* Some entity will need to run the logging service and a trusted entity is preferred.\n* Certificate Authorities will likely need to monitor the logging service for consistency.\n* Certificate revocation is unchanged and remains outside of Certificate Transparency, but certificates needing to be revoked are visible.\n* Technique dependent of reliable feed of new and updated certificates\n* Some certificate authorities allow for certificates to be registered with wildcards in the FQDN and thus will fail some of the subdomain scoring\n* Phishing HTTP domains will not be discovered",[8652,8654],{"@id":8653},"d3f:Reference-CertificateTransparency",{"@id":8655},"d3f:Reference-StreamingPhish",[8657],"Passive Certificate Analysis",[8659],{"@id":5634},{"@id":8033,"@type":8661,"d3f:d3fend-id":8662,"d3f:definition":8664,"d3f:kb-reference":8666,"d3f:synonym":8669,"rdfs:label":8671,"rdfs:subClassOf":8673},[1421,8033,1422],[8663],"D3-PLLM",[8665],"Passive logical link mapping only listens to network traffic as a means to map the the whole data link layer, where the links represent logical data flows rather than physical connections.",[8667],{"@id":8668},"d3f:Reference-TenablePassiveNetworkMonitoring",[8670],"Passive Logical Layer Mapping",[8672],"Passive Logical Link Mapping",[8674],{"@id":5655},{"@id":8312,"@type":8676,"d3f:analyzes":8677,"d3f:d3fend-id":8679,"d3f:definition":8681,"d3f:kb-article":8683,"d3f:kb-reference":8685,"rdfs:label":8688,"rdfs:subClassOf":8690},[8312,1421,1422],[8678],{"@id":2329},[8680],"D3-PHDURA",[8682],"Detecting anomalies that indicate malicious activity by comparing the amount of data downloaded versus data uploaded by a host.",[8684],"## How it works\nAggregate pull vs. push ratios from metadata are used to develop a baseline for a given host over a specific time period, e.g., over a three-hour period, one day, one week, etc. Anomalies identified over a threshold produce an alert.\n\n## Considerations\nCollection and analysis of large network packet captures requires large storage and intensive computing power.

A Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) is a cryptographic hash or derivative computed on the value of a pointer and some additional context information which can then provide a cryptographically strong guarantee about the likelihood that a pointer has been tampered with by an attacker.\n\nAlthough pointers are 64 bits, most systems have a substantially smaller virtual address space, leaving unused bits in pointers that can store the value of the PAC, this can be done to reduce memory space requirements. One implementation is in ARMv8.3-A.  A PAC is computed over the 64-bit pointer value and a 64-bit context value.  Instructions are introduced to deal with pointers: one category to compute and insert the PAC into a pointer, another category to verify the pointer and invalidate the pointer if the PAC does not check, and a third category to remove the pointer and restore the original value without verifying.\n\nThe ARM standard specifies a cryptographic algorithm called QARMA-64 (designed by Qualcomm) to compute the signature, although this algorithm is not required.  The architecture provides for five secret 128-bit Pointer Authentication keys: two for instruction pointers, two for data pointers, and a general key for signing larger blocks of data.\n\n## Considerations\n\nIn the ARM implementation, the mechanisms above for manipulating PACS are provided, but it is up to the code developer to manage the keys for the cryptographic algorithm.\n\n\nA known potential limitation of PACs concerns signing gadgets. Under certain circumstances PACs can be bypassed by forcing the system to run a signing gadget which will allow the signing of arbitrary pointers to occur.",[8804,8806],{"@id":8805},"d3f:Reference-PointerAuthenticationOnARMv8.3",{"@id":8807},"d3f:Reference-PointerAuthenticationProjectZero",[8809],"Pointer Authentication",[8811,8812],{"@id":5732},{"@id":8813},"_:t220927",{"@id":6461,"@type":8815,"d3f:children":8816,"d3f:d3fend-id":8831,"d3f:definition":8833,"d3f:enables":8835,"rdfs:label":8837,"rdfs:subClassOf":8839},[1422,6461,1421],[8817,8819,8821,8823,8824,8825,8826,8827,8829],{"@id":8818},"d3f:ProcessSpawnAnalysis",{"@id":8820},"d3f:ScriptExecutionAnalysis",{"@id":8822},"d3f:ShadowStackComparisons",{"@id":7267},{"@id":6442},{"@id":7141},{"@id":7877},{"@id":8828},"d3f:ProcessCodeSegmentVerification",{"@id":8830},"d3f:ProcessSelf-ModificationDetection",[8832],"D3-PA",[8834],"Process Analysis consists of observing a running application process and analyzing it to watch for certain behaviors or conditions which may indicate adversary activity.

Further research may provide specific detail on such methods used.\n\n### System-provided functions\n\n#### Windows tools\nIn Windows, `ExitProcess()` is used to send a signal to a process to request it to exit, and `TerminateProcess()` is used to force a process to exit.\n\nThe `taskkill` executable available in the cmd shell is used to kill a process, with the `/F` switch forcing termination as with `TerminateProcess()`.  In PowerShell, `Stop-Process` is used, which is aliased by default to `spps` and `kill`.  Processes started in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment may be terminated there with the `kill` command.\n\nIn some cases, existing drivers can also be leveraged to kill processes.\n\n#### Unix/Linux tools\nIn Unix-like systems, all process termination requests are handled using signals.  The `kill` function takes the Process ID and signal to send, and is accessible with the `kill` command.  Some shells have a `kill` builtin function which is separate than the `kill` binary, which can also kill background jobs in the shell and additionally perform the function faster, and can run from an existing instance of the shell if the process table is full.  The signal SIGTERM specifies that the process to terminate may invoke a handler that it has defined instead of terminating, and the signal SIGKILL forces immediate termination.\n\nThe related command `xkill` terminates the connection of a program to the X window server, after which the user process may decide to terminate itself; however, termination is not guaranteed as the process, which could be on the same or different host, could then run in a terminal or reconnect to a different X server on any host.  Emacs is such a program that would not terminate itself after its connection to the X server is terminated.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Persistence Mechanisms\nTerminating a malicious process is not enough to stop an adversary that has already gained persistence in the host via any initial access mechanism, including through that process or another access mechanism.\n\n### Terminating Multiple Processes\nOn most operating systems, process termination operations typically occur independently of each other, without functionality provided to atomically terminate multiple processes.  If there are multiple malicious processes which can make system calls to spawn other processes once one of them is closed, user session termination or system restart might be required.\n\n### Process Access Permissions\nUsers must have permissions to kill the process.  On Unix-like systems, either root or the process user can kill the process.  On Windows systems, process permissions are managed separately via process security tokens.\n\n### Process Resource Handles\n\n#### Terminating Processes with Open Resource Handles\n\nProcesses may have open resource handles, which could leave those resources in an undesired state if the process is forced to terminate.  As such, most operating systems provide a means to send a signal to a process to inform it to gracefully terminate, and on most of these operating systems, it is the typical first step used to terminate a process.\n\n#### Signal Traps\nAs the process may have open resource handles, commonly-used methods of process termination involve sending a signal to the process to terminate.\nOn Windows, the `ExitProcess()` function is used for this purpose.  Process instructions, as well as a third-party DLL can also cause the process to exit.\nOn Linux, the process is sent a signal on the occurrence of various events: when it loses the console, `SIGHUP`; when termination is requested, `SIGTERM`.  The processor then redirects execution to the function registered to handle the signal.\n\nTherefore, sending a signal to the process to ask it to terminate may not always work.\n\n##### Avoiding Signal Traps\n\nOn Unix-like systems, sending the `SIGKILL` signal for a process does not send a message to the process or invoke an implementation-defined handler; instead, it immediately does not allow the process to execute any further processor instructions.   On Windows `TerminateProcess()` instead of `ExitProcess()` performs the equivalent.\n\n#### Hang on System Call Execution\n\nEven still, as the operating system kernel manages the processes, kernel code may block process signals, including those which cannot be trapped, and does in certain circumstances.  Signals are blocked and queued for the duration of the system call when interrupting the system call would result in a kernel invariant being violated, such as when an action results in a malformed data structure; this blocking is common for filesystem requests.  Such system calls can hang when a filesystem has gone offline, leading to a long-term uninterruptible sleep, represented in POSIX command `ps` output as D state.\nAny malicious system calls or system call handlers are issues of a much larger problem (a kernel-level rootkit) and the system should be redeployed entirely or restored from a backup known to be prior to compromise, and other systems accessible directly and indirectly from that one should also be examined.\n\nA process that is truly hung in a system call may prevent the system from shutting down and leave it in an unresponsive state; a hard power off is required.\n\nTo speed up the action of terminating a process in uninterruptible sleep, the process resource accesses (handles) could be analyzed.\n\nOn Linux, [`sync` followed by `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) is a safe way to free up some inactive resource handles.\n\n\n#### Kernel Processes and Threads\nThe kernel may not allow kernel processes, which are created via methods other than user-space processes, to be terminated.\n\n#### Other Code using the Process\n\nTerminating a shared library can lead to unexpected errors; such shared libraries have their own mechanisms for termination.\n\nOn Windows, a DLL is unloaded when the reference count of the library reaches 0.\n\n#### Zombie process\n\nAfter a process has been terminated, it may still take up an entry in the operating system process table until another event occurs.\n\n##### Windows\nIn Windows, a process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed.\n\n##### Linux\nIn Linux, a process is removed from the process table when it is reaped by its parent process.

The network traffic is collected into inspection groups. The groups of traffic are assembled into distinct pair flows (outbound/inbound) and the pair flows are further divided into sessions.

A detection engine groups the session traffic data, between the hosts, into rapid exchange instances. Analysis of rapid exchange traffic patterns can lead to the discovery of abnormal behavior which is indicative of a compromised internal host. The analysis algorithms look for patterns in the traffic which correlate to known activity (e.g., relay attacks, bot activity, bitcoin mining).

If the addresses are changed each time the program is run, then it becomes more difficult for the attacker to determine the location that will contain the code they wish to run.\n\nImported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \"rebasing.\"  Just as not all code is built for participation in ASLR, not all modules can be rebased; instead, modules must indicate whether they implement support for rebasing.  Such information to relocate the executable is typically stored in the \".reloc\" segment -- each of the addresses pointed to in this segment has its address increased by the amount of the offset.\n(An alternative method for relocation would be to add an amount to a global variable each time -- leading to less overhead in the module load, but more for each access.  Still another implementation could instead contain code to deference each changeable memory location on the fly, so that each of the references do not need to be updated.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nAs the offset for each segment is constant, it is possible to guess at the value of the address given the address of another variable.  Alternatively, memory pointers may be kept around, which contain the address of another variable.\nAnother bypass technique is known as an \"egg hunt,\" whereby the attacker searches for a rather unique piece of the data or code in memory to determine its likely address.\n\nThe program needs to store these addresses for the functions somewhere.  In Linux, the PLT contains a \"trampoline\" to these addresses.  If an attacker desires to jump to the start of an existing function, they can jump directly to the trampoline anyway, and may have the opportunity to provide their own stack frame to the function with a write to the stack. If they overwrite a saved stack pointer which is loaded back into memory, or execute a function, that changes the address of a stack pointer.\n\nIf an attacker wants to inject some data into the program, for example as a parameter to a known function that is not under ASLR or a pointer to a trampoline function in the PLT, then they can repeat the data until they exceed the range of ASLR coverage, which on 32-bit systems is accomplishable in a few seconds with a heap spray.  Microsoft's EMET and Windows 10 Exploit Guard can pre-allocate particular addresses that are commonly used in heap sprays.  However, in many products, there does not seem to be nearly a complete coverage of such addresses, which only need to be executable and in the range of the heap; 0x0c0c0c0c is such an address that is commonly used for the x86 processor architecture, as when executed it only performs a numeric operation to a register four times.",[9569,9571],{"@id":9570},"d3f:Reference-DYNAMICBASE_UseAddressSpaceLayoutRandomization_MicrosoftDocs",{"@id":9572},"d3f:Reference-HowASLRProtectsLinuxSystemsFromBufferOverflowAttacks_NetworkWorld",[9574],{"@id":1793},[9576,9577],"Address Space Layout Randomization","ASLR",[9579],"Segment Address Offset Randomization",[9581,9582],{"@id":5732},{"@id":9583},"_:t220685",{"@id":8104,"@type":9585,"d3f:analyzes":9586,"d3f:d3fend-id":9588,"d3f:definition":9590,"d3f:kb-article":9592,"d3f:kb-reference":9594,"rdfs:label":9597,"rdfs:subClassOf":9599},[1421,1422,8104],[9587],{"@id":2439},[9589],"D3-SMRA",[9591],"Characterizing the reputation of mail transfer agents (MTA) to determine the security risk in emails.",[9593],"## How it works\nThe sender message transfer agent (MTA) trust rating can be considered an indicator of the level of security risk and/or a trust level associated with sender MTAs in an email header.\n\nThe features considered in determining the trust rating may include:\n\n* Length of time MTA has interacted with the enterprise\n* Number of sender domains sending emails from the MTA\n* Number of recipients in the enterprise the MTA sends emails to\n* Number of emails received from this MTA\n* Number of email replies received from this MTA\n\nFor example, higher values for the length of time an MTA has interacted with the enterprise, or number of emails received from an MTA can result in a higher trust rating.

Stack Frame Canary Verification inserts instructions at the prologue and epilogue of desired functions.  In the prologue, a canary value, typically with the same size as the register size, is stored in the system of record and on the stack.  Typically, the canary is loaded to where it has a memory address just below that of the saved instruction pointer and base pointer.  In the epilogue, the canary value stored on the stack and, is compared to the canary value in the system of record.  If the values are different, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.\n\nStack Frame Canary Verification is commonly used to detect potential tampering of a saved register value on the stack before it has been restored.  Examples of registers with values commonly saved to the stack include the instruction pointer and the base pointer.\n\nThe canary should be stored between where the start of a buffer overrun is likely, and the data to protect, in cases where the buffer size increases it will overwrite the data to be protected.\n\nOn most processor architectures, including x86, x64, and ARM, a \"push\" operation to store data to the stack grows the stack towards a lower memory address.  As in these architectures, saved register values are stored to the stack at a point in time just before space is made for the local function variables, the saved register values have a higher address than that of the local function variables.  Values at increasing indexes of a buffer are written to increasing memory addresses; therefore, an overwrite in the local variable buffer could overwrite saved register values, and a stack canary between these two would be useful in detecting an overwrite.\n\nOn some other processor architectures such as the B5000, the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, and some architectures, such as System Z and RCA1802A, stack direction can be chosen.  If the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, while this architecture inherently provides more protection against a saved register being overwritten, other data including local function variables might be overwritten.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nThere are several ways that the protection provided by a canary could be rendered ineffective.\n\n### Performing a malicious action before the canary is checked\n\nIf the attacker alters the memory in such a way that it performs a malicious action before the epilogue is called, then this protection will not be effective.  This includes altering the logic of the program by altering the values of local variables stored on the function stack, or by causing an exception and exploiting the exception mechanism such as the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) mechanism on Windows.\n\n### Determining the canary value\n\nDetermining the canary value is possible through reading memory either for the code used to check the canary, or from the stored canary value itself in a stack frame.\n\n### Changing the canary value\n\nA vulnerability such as a write-what-where condition that allows one to write data after the canary in the stack, would allow control of the value of the saved instruction pointer without needing to know the canary value.",[9755,9757],{"@id":9756},"d3f:Reference-GS_BufferSecurityCheck_MicrosoftDocs",{"@id":9758},"d3f:Reference-StackSmashingProtection_StackGuard_RedHat",[9760],{"@id":4790},[9762],"Stack Frame Canary Validation",[9764,9765],{"@id":5732},{"@id":9766},"_:t220529",{"@id":6503,"@type":9768,"d3f:d3fend-id":9769,"d3f:definition":9771,"d3f:kb-article":9773,"d3f:kb-reference":9775,"d3f:spoofs":9777,"rdfs:label":9779,"rdfs:subClassOf":9781},[6503,1421,1422],[9770],"D3-SHN",[9772],"An environment created for the purpose of attracting attackers and eliciting their behaviors that is not connected to any production enterprise systems.",[9774],"## How it works\nA standalone honeynet does not directly interact with the real enterprise environment.

The TPM hashes those measurements and stores the hashes in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).  Upon a subsequent boot, these hashes are provided to a verifier which compares the stored measurements to the new boot measurements. Integrity of the boot components is assured if they match.\n\nAttestation of the secure boot occurs when a verifying entity requests a Quote which is a concatenation of the requested PCR values, hashed and signed by the TPM's unique RSA key.

In Email, Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Email (DKIM) or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) are used to validate sender domain ownership.\n\n### SPF\nSPF protocol allows for mail domain owners to specify the mail servers they use when sending email. SPF requires the use of SPF records published in the Domain Name System (DNS). The records record the authorized IPs for email senders. SPF uses the return-path address for domain IP identification. Email that is forwarded may cause the return-path validation problems.\n### DKIM\nDKIM also uses a record entry in DNS for authentication but does not rely on the simple return-path for validation. A signature header is added to email and encryption is used for security. This adds an additional layer of complexity and requires that DKIM servers be configured identified cryptographic signatures. The additional complexity results in a validation process that can survive complex routing of emails.\n\n### DMARC\nDMARC is an email policy and authentication protocol that seeks to ensure that the \"From\" field of emails is not spoofed. DMARC makes use of both SPF records and DKIM published key validation. DMARC also has a decision policy framework, contained in a DMARC record, for handling of rejected email. The DMARC framework also updates DMARC domains with authentication statues for allowed senders of that domain.\n\n## Considerations\n- Additional work is required to ensure that all SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are current and up to date.\n- Maintenance of DKIM signing keys is needed.\n- Using SPF without DKIM and DMARC verifies the Return-Path domain however does not prevent spoofing of the displayed From: address.\n- Parts of an email that are not signed or verified by email authentication methods, such as the message body or the header To: and Subject: fields, can be altered or modified.\n- Email message authentication does not replace the need to do email content analysis since executables, attachments, or links or other parts of the email beyond the sender domain are not verified.",[10060,10061,10063],{"@id":8137},{"@id":10062},"d3f:Reference-RFC7208-SenderPolicyFramework-SPF-ForAuthorizingUseOfDomainsInEmail-IETF",{"@id":10064},"d3f:Reference-RFC7489-Domain-basedMessageAuthentication-Reporting-AndConformance-DMARC",[10066],"Transfer Agent Authentication",[10068],{"@id":6689},{"@id":7779,"@type":10070,"d3f:analyzes":10071,"d3f:d3fend-id":10073,"d3f:definition":10075,"d3f:kb-article":10077,"d3f:kb-reference":10079,"rdfs:label":10084,"rdfs:subClassOf":10086},[7779,1421,1422],[10072],{"@id":2856},[10074],"D3-UA",[10076],"Determining if a URL is benign or malicious by analyzing the URL or its components.",[10078],"## How it works\n\nURLs may contain components, for example:\n\n * scheme\n * userinfo\n * host name\n * port\n * path\n * query\n * fragment\n\nThese components are used as features in analysis algorithms.\n\nContextual information about a URL such as where it is embedded (ex. emails, files, network protocols), header, path, location, and origin information, as well as information about the content returned from the URL request, may be incorporated into an analytic for URL analysis.
