We’ve kept it as beta releases since, using <a href="https://semver.org/" rel="nofollow">semantic versioning</a> to indicate to other software engineers that things might change and to not expect stability. This was necessary due to the way D3FEND was designed and built. We knew that if we released a formal ontology, in OWL2-DL, that developers would start building applications on top of D3FEND’s <a href="/resources/ontology/">ontological model</a>. As we expected, we were contacted by numerous people who were building tools even with the beta release. Thus, we had to make sure we communicated expectations on stability of the model clearly to these sorts of developers. In short, this approach did effectively communicate our maturity level and our users seemed to understand that things might change in the model.',g,C,E="Now that we have received two years of feedback, seen numerous vendors apply D3FEND, and have nearly doubled the size of the initial release, we are ready to indicate stability.

We have not yet made this aspect of D3FEND easy or obvious as the primitives for this are buried in our <a href="/resources/ontology">ontology files</a>. Reasoning applications (think smart recommendation systems) are difficult to build. This is further a challenge because we are going for maximum compatibility with our technology stack.
