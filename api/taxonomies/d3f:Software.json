This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually called bugfixes or bug fixes, and improving the usability or performance. Although meant to fix problems, poorly designed patches can sometimes introduce new problems (see software regressions). In some special cases updates may knowingly break the functionality, for instance, by removing components for which the update provider is no longer licensed or disabling a device.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patch_(computing)"},"rdfs:label":"Software Patch","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:Software"},"skos:altLabel":"Patch"},{"@id":"d3f:SourceCodeAnalyzerTool","@type":"owl:Class","rdfs:comment":"A source code analyzer tool is a static analysis tool that operates specifically on source code, but not object code.","rdfs:label":"Source Code Analyzer Tool","rdfs:seeAlso":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Static_program_analysis"},"rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:StaticAnalysisTool"}},{"@id":"d3f:StaticAnalysisTool","@type":"owl:Class","rdfs:comment":"A static [program] analysis tool performs an automated analysis of computer software without actually executing programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is analysis performed on programs while they are executing.
