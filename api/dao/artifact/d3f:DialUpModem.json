This contrasts with leased line modems, which also operate over lines provided by a telephone company, but ones which are intended for data use and do not impose the same signaling constraints. The modulated data must fit the frequency constraints of a normal voice audio signal, and the modem must be able to perform the actions needed to connect a call through a telephone exchange, namely: picking up the line, dialing, understanding signals sent back by phone company equipment (dial tone, ringing, busy signal,) and on the far end of the call, the second modem in the connection must be able to recognize the incoming ring signal and answer the line.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Modem#Dial-up"},"rdfs:label":"Dial Up Modem","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:Modem"}},{"@id":"d3f:Modem"},{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Modem#Dial-up"}]},"neighbors":{"@context":{"d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","children":{"@id":"d3f:child","@type":"@id","@container":"@set"}},"@graph":[]}}
