While this is technically considered “plurality voting”, the term, “majority vote” is more commonly used in literature. The distinction between these terminologies is that “majority voting” technically requires a majority of greater than 50%, which primarily works when there are only two categories. When you have multiple classes-e.g. four categories, you don’t necessarily need 50% of the vote to make a conclusion about a class; you could assign a class label with a vote of greater than 25%.\n\n\n## References\nK-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
