This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash. In this technique, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a Credential Access technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.","rdfs:comment":"This technique has been revoked by T1550.002","rdfs:label":"Pass the Hash","rdfs:seeAlso":"T1550.002","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:LateralMovementTechnique"},"owl:deprecated":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","@value":"true"}}]},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"},"@graph":[]}}
