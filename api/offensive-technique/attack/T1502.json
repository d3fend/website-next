New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the <code>CreateProcess</code> API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.(Citation: DidierStevens SelectMyParent Nov 2009) This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via <code>svchost.exe</code> or <code>consent.exe</code>) rather than the current user context.(Citation: Microsoft UAC Nov 2018)","rdfs:comment":"This technique has been revoked by T1134.004","rdfs:label":"Parent PID Spoofing","rdfs:seeAlso":"T1134.004","rdfs:subClassOf":[{"@id":"d3f:DefenseEvasionTechnique"},{"@id":"d3f:PrivilegeEscalationTechnique"}],"owl:deprecated":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","@value":"true"}}]},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"},"@graph":[]}}
