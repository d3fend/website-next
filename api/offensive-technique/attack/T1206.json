This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).","rdfs:comment":"This technique has been revoked by T1548.003","rdfs:label":"Sudo Caching","rdfs:seeAlso":"T1548.003","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:PrivilegeEscalationTechnique"},"owl:deprecated":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","@value":"true"}}]},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"},"@graph":[]}}
