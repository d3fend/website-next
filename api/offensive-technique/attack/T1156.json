User shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command line interface or remotely logs in (such as SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use <code>/etc/profile</code> when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.","rdfs:comment":"This technique has been revoked by T1546.004","rdfs:label":"Malicious Shell Modification","rdfs:seeAlso":"T1546.004","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:PersistenceTechnique"},"owl:deprecated":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","@value":"true"}}]},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"},"@graph":[]}}
