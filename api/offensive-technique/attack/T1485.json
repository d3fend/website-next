This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.","rdfs:label":"Data Destruction","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:ImpactTechnique"}}]},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"},"@graph":[]}}
