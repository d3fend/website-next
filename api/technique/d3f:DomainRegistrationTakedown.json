Performing a WHOIS query on the attacker's domain will provide a contact that can be notified in the case of abuse. Formal takedown processes should be initiated to suspend or disable the normal function of the domain name.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Takedown notifications should clearly demonstrate (with evidence) that the nameserver or registrars Terms and Conditions have been breached.\n- Takedown processes are notoriously slow and sometimes unsuccessful.\n- Many government organisations will have takedown processes that should also be followed. They may use this for intelligence to assist other organisations suffering an attack.\n- Top level domain registrars will have takedown processes that can be followed, as an escalation path, when the nameserver host and/or registrar have not responded or complied timeously or inline with the TLD expectations.\n\n## Examples of Domain Registration Abuse\n\nAttackers will create infrastructure from which to carry out their operations and this may include registering domain names to be used in the various attacks. Known misuse cases include:\n\n- Registering domain names that are similar to the victim's. This is known as typosquatting or URL hijacking. Legitimate looking mails or URLs could be sent using this domain in phishing campaigns.\n- Registring domain names that are used in C2 beacons.","d3f:kb-reference":{"@id":"d3f:Reference-UnderstandingtheDomainRegistrationBehaviorofSpammers"},"rdfs:label":"Domain Registration Takedown","rdfs:subClassOf":{"@id":"d3f:ObjectEviction"}}]},"digital_artifacts":{"head":{"vars":["query_def_tech_label","top_def_tech_label","def_tech_label","def_artifact_rel_label","def_artifact_label","def_tactic","def_tactic_rel","def_tech","def_artifact_rel","def_artifact"]},"results":{"bindings":[{"query_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Domain Registration Takedown"},"top_def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Object Eviction"},"def_tech_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Domain Registration Takedown"},"def_artifact_rel_label":{"type":"literal","value":"deletes"},"def_artifact_label":{"type":"literal","value":"Domain Registration"},"def_tactic":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#Evict"},"def_tactic_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#enables"},"def_tech":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#DomainRegistrationTakedown"},"def_artifact_rel":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#deletes"},"def_artifact":{"type":"uri","value":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#DomainRegistration"}}]}},"subtechniques":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#","skos":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"},"@graph":[]},"related_offensive_matrix":{},"references":{"@context":{"rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","d3f":"http://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#"},"@graph":[{"@id":"d3f:Reference-UnderstandingtheDomainRegistrationBehaviorofSpammers","@type":["d3f:AcademicPaperReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=bf4d34a6f9d0168bb07433e84c1567bbe1ba8188"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"Spammers register a tremendous number of domains to evade blacklisting and takedown efforts. Current techniques to detect such domains rely on crawling spam URLs or monitoring lookup traffic. Such detection techniques are only effective after the spammers have already launched their campaigns, and thus these countermeasures may only come into play after the spammer has already reaped significant benefits from the dissemination of large volumes of spam. In this paper we examine the registration process of such domains, with a particular eye towards features that might indicate that a given domain likely has a malicious purpose at registration time, before it is ever used for an attack. Our assessment includes exploring the characteristics of registrars, domain life cycles, registration bursts, and naming patterns. By investigating zone changes from the .com TLD over a 5-month period, we discover that spammers employ bulk registration, that they often re-use domains previously registered by others, and that they tend to register and host their domains over a small set of registrars. Our findings suggest steps that registries or registrars could use to frustrate the efforts of miscreants to acquire domains in bulk, ultimately reducing their agility for mounting large-scale attacks.","d3f:kb-author":"Hao S, Thomas M, Paxson V, Feamster N, Kreibich C, Grier C, Hollenbeck S","d3f:kb-reference-of":{"@id":"d3f:DomainRegistrationTakedown"},"d3f:kb-reference-title":"Understanding the Domain Registration Behavior of Spammers","d3f:reference-type-label":"Academic Paper","rdfs:label":"Reference - Understanding the Domain Registration Behavior of Spammers"}]},"references_meta":{"Academic Paper":1}}
