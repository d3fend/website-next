The remediation signature essentially comprises a sequence of actions to address a corresponding vulnerability. A managed automated approach to the process is contemplated in which the system is capable of selective deployment of remediation signatures; selective resolution of vulnerabilities; scheduled deployment of remediation signatures; and scheduled scanning of client computers for vulnerabilities.","d3f:kb-author":"Carl E.

The method includes accessing host configuration information of a host and querying a vulnerability database based on the host configuration information. The method further includes receiving a list of vulnerabilities and accessing a plurality of vulnerability scores. The list of vulnerabilities corresponds to vulnerabilities of the host. Vulnerabilities can be removed from the list based on checking for installed fixes corresponding to vulnerability. A composite risk score can then be determined for the host a nd each software product of the host based on the plurality of vulnerability scores. An aggregate risk score can then be determined for the host and each software product of the host based on the plurality of vulnerability scores.","d3f:kb-author":"Matthew Cruz Elder, Darrell Martin Kienzle, Pratyusa K.
